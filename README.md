# lukkien_code_snippet

•	Instagram Automation Tool (2017 Version): This code snippet is from the Instagram automation tool I created in 2017, which demonstrates the logic behind automating interactions on Instagram.
•	Shopify Modules: The included Shopify-related code is an old version of my Shopify modules, updated to give an understanding of the original logic and functionality.
•	Code Enhancements: I have added extra comments throughout the code to explain the logic, providing clarity on how each part of the tool and modules work.
•	Confidential Information Removed: Any confidential or sensitive information has been intentionally removed from both code files.
•	Missing Modules: The files shared do not include other crucial modules, such as those for validation, automation, authentication, and build management, which are part of the complete system.
•	Purpose: These code snippets serve as a reference to give you an idea of the projects I’ve worked on, focusing on the core logic rather than the full, deployed solution.
